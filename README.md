README



I first used the code provided as a starter code, to fill in the blanks.

As I typed the code identical to the one provided, I filled in the necessary places that my images would go, dubbing it image 1-5, using that as a placeholder.

Then I viewed it as a webpage using the live server so I could have real time example of my work completeing as I went along.

I then started on the CSS.Style file.

I copied the style file from the starter pack, learning what each elemnet does and how it works in the main page. 

I added images as placeholders.

I then went back and added to my code

<body>
    <!-- Navigation Bar -->
<header>
    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <nav>
        <a href="#about">About Me</a>
        <a href="#work">Work Done By the Author</a>
        <a href="#contact">Get In Touch</a>
        <a href="#">Resume</a>
    </nav>
</header>

<!-- Hero Banner -->
<section class="hero-banner">
    <div>
        <h2>Manny's portfolio</h2>
    </div>
</section>

I fixed an error I made, thus fixing my webpage.

I then styled the code by adding my own colors to the variable, adjusted the font, aligned the text right and left.

I added my own image for the placeholder.

I then did a thorough review of my code, both the html and css to fix errors and comment on any changes.

I added some finishing touches.

These include

-Link to my resume

-A section for skills

-Finishing comments on my code
